# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Excellence
All content must be technically accurate, pedagogically sound, and accessible to the target audience. Content must include practical examples, exercises, and real-world applications.

### Technical Accuracy
All technical content must be factually correct, up-to-date with current standards, and reviewed by domain experts. Code examples must be tested and functional.

### Modular Structure
Content must be organized in discrete, self-contained modules that can be consumed independently while maintaining coherent progression. Each module must have clear prerequisites.

### Open Source Collaboration
All content must be licensed appropriately for open collaboration. Contributions must follow established review processes and maintain quality standards.

### Accessibility Standards
All content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Alternative formats must be available for different learning needs and technical capabilities.

### Docusaurus Framework Compliance
The project must use Docusaurus v3 with TypeScript as the foundation for the textbook website. All configuration files must be in TypeScript format.

## Technical Architecture
All technical implementations must adhere to the following requirements:
- Framework: Docusaurus v3 (using the classic preset)
- Language: TypeScript for all configuration files and custom components
- Deployment Target: GitHub Pages (Configure `docusaurus.config.ts` for deployment)
- Project Structure: Follow the specified directory organization with docs, src, and configuration files

## Content Organization
The textbook must be organized into the following modules:
- Module 1: ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Module 2: Digital Twin
- Module 3: AI Robot Brain
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Amendments require explicit documentation and approval. All contributions must verify compliance with these principles. The project must maintain a clear versioning strategy following semantic versioning principles.
