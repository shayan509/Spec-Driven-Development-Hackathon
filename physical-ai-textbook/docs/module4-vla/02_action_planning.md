# From Human Command to Robot Action

Converting human commands into executable robot actions requires sophisticated planning pipelines that bridge high-level intentions with low-level motor commands.

## Planning Pipeline Overview

The process of translating human commands to robot actions involves several key stages:

- **Command Parsing**: Understanding the linguistic structure of the human command
- **Goal Generation**: Converting the parsed command into specific operational goals
- **Execution Planning**: Creating detailed sequences of actions to achieve the goals

## Command Parsing and Goal Generation

Natural language commands must be parsed to extract semantic meaning and convert them into actionable objectives that the robot can understand and execute.

## Execution Planning

The final stage involves generating detailed motor commands that execute the planned actions while adapting to real-world conditions and potential obstacles.
