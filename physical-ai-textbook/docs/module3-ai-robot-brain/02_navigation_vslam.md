# Visual SLAM and Environment Mapping

Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) is a critical capability for autonomous robots, allowing them to understand and navigate through unknown environments.

## VSLAM Algorithms

VSLAM algorithms enable robots to:

- Build 3D maps of their environment using visual sensors
- Determine their position within these maps in real-time
- Plan optimal paths through complex environments
- Avoid obstacles dynamically as they move

## Generating 3D Maps and Path Planning

The process of creating 3D maps from visual input involves several sophisticated algorithms that process camera images to extract features, track them across frames, and reconstruct the 3D structure of the environment. These maps then serve as the foundation for path planning algorithms that enable safe and efficient navigation.
