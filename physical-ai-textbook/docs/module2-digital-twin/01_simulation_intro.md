# Simulation and the Digital Twin Concept

Digital twins and simulation are essential tools in robotics development. They allow engineers to test and validate robot behaviors in a safe, controlled environment before deploying to real hardware.

## Why Simulators Are Essential for Robotics

Simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity provide several critical advantages:

- **Safety**: Test dangerous scenarios without risk to hardware or humans
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce need for physical prototypes and testing equipment
- **Repeatability**: Run identical tests multiple times for consistent results
- **Speed**: Accelerate development cycles by running simulations faster than real-time

These simulation tools form the foundation of modern robotics development workflows, enabling rapid iteration and validation of complex robotic systems.
