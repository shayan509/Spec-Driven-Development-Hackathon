# Tasks: Docusaurus Content Structure and Configuration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-docusaurus-structure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No explicit test requirements in feature specification - tests are not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Docusaurus project**: `docs/`, `src/`, `docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts` at project root
- Paths shown below follow the Docusaurus project structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create physical-ai-textbook project structure
- [X] T002 [P] Install Docusaurus v3 dependencies with npm
- [X] T003 [P] Verify project builds successfully with `npm run build`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Configure docusaurus.config.ts with site metadata (title, tagline)
- [X] T005 [P] Configure navbar with Docs and GitHub links in docusaurus.config.ts
- [X] T006 [P] Set up GitHub Pages deployment configuration in docusaurus.config.ts
- [X] T007 Create sidebars.ts with textbookSidebar structure
- [X] T008 Configure Dracula theme for code blocks in docusaurus.config.ts
- [X] T009 Enable hideable sidebar functionality in docusaurus.config.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Textbook Content (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Create organized navigation structure with four main modules (ROS2, Digital Twin, AI Robot Brain, VLA) that allows users to access textbook content efficiently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through the textbook structure and verifying that content is accessible and well-organized, delivering the foundational educational experience.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create module1-ros2 directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Create module2-digital-twin directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/
- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Create module3-ai-robot-brain directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Create module4-vla directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Create 01_introduction.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module1-ros2/
- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Create 01_simulation_intro.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module2-digital-twin/
- [X] T016 [P] [US1] Create 01_perception.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/
- [X] T017 [P] [US1] Create 01_llm_robotics_intro.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module4-vla/
- [X] T018 [US1] Update sidebars.ts to include all four modules with autogenerated content
- [X] T019 [US1] Add placeholder content mentioning core topics in each module
- [X] T020 [US1] Verify navigation works between all modules and chapters

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Configure Professional Theme (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Configure a professional dark theme for the textbook website to provide optimal reading experience with reduced eye strain.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the Dracula theme is applied to all code blocks and the overall site appearance matches the professional standard.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T021 [P] [US2] Configure Dracula theme as default for light mode in docusaurus.config.ts
- [X] T022 [P] [US2] Configure Dracula theme as default for dark mode in docusaurus.config.ts
- [X] T023 [US2] Add sample code blocks to module content to test syntax highlighting
- [X] T024 [US2] Verify consistent dark theme application across all pages
- [X] T025 [US2] Test code block rendering with various programming languages

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Navigate Content Efficiently (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable users to hide/show the sidebar when viewing content to maximize reading space on medium-sized screens.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling the sidebar visibility and verifying that content layout adjusts appropriately.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T026 [P] [US3] Enable sidebarCollapsible option in docusaurus.config.ts docs preset
- [X] T027 [P] [US3] Set sidebarCollapsible to true for textbook content in docusaurus.config.ts
- [X] T028 [US3] Test sidebar hide/show functionality on various screen sizes
- [X] T029 [US3] Verify content area expands properly when sidebar is hidden
- [X] T030 [US3] Test responsive behavior on medium-sized screens (768px-1024px)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T031 [P] Add proper frontmatter with sidebar_position to all content files
- [X] T032 [P] Update README.md with setup and run instructions for the textbook
- [X] T033 Add logo configuration to navbar in docusaurus.config.ts
- [X] T034 [P] Add 02_communication.md to physical-ai-textbook/docs/module1-ros2/
- [X] T035 [P] Add 02_creating_urdf.md to physical-ai-textbook/docs/module2-digital-twin/
- [X] T036 [P] Add 02_navigation_vslam.md to physical-ai-textbook/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/
- [X] T037 [P] Add 02_action_planning.md to physical-ai-textbook/docs/module4-vla/
- [X] T038 Run full site build and verify all links work correctly
- [X] T039 Test site navigation and functionality across different browsers

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all directory creation tasks together:
Task: "Create module1-ros2 directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/"
Task: "Create module2-digital-twin directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/"
Task: "Create module3-ai-robot-brain directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/"
Task: "Create module4-vla directory in physical-ai-textbook/docs/"

# Launch all content creation tasks together:
Task: "Create 01_introduction.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module1-ros2/"
Task: "Create 01_simulation_intro.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module2-digital-twin/"
Task: "Create 01_perception.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/"
Task: "Create 01_llm_robotics_intro.md in physical-ai-textbook/docs/module4-vla/"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence/
