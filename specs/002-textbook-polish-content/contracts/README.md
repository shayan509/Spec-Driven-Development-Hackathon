# Contracts Directory

This directory is included as part of the standard project structure, but remains empty for this feature because the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook is a static documentation site built with Docusaurus v3.

No API contracts are required for this implementation since:
- The site is statically generated
- No backend services are involved
- All content is delivered as static files
- No client-server communication APIs exist
